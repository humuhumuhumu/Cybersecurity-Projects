## Static Analysis of orange.exe: A Malware Teardown
In this project, I performed a static analysis of the malware sample orange.exe. My objective was to reverse engineer its core functionalities without running the code, focusing on identifying persistence mechanisms and any secondary payloads.

## Tools Used
Analysis Environment: Linux host with a Windows VM

Disassembler: IDA Freeware

File Transfer: Python http.server and xfreerdp

## Analysis Walkthrough
1. Finding the Foothold: Hunting for Persistence
After loading the executable into IDA Freeware, I began hunting for suspicious Windows API calls. My attention was quickly drawn to a call to RegOpenKeyExA, a function commonly used to modify the registry. Malware frequently abuses registry "Run keys" to ensure it automatically executes every time the computer starts.

The author of this malware attempted to hide the registry key by breaking it into several small strings and pushing them onto the stack individually before the function call.

By examining the stack in reverse order, I pieced the fragments together:
"ware\\M" + "roso" + "t\\W" + "ow" + "\\Cu" + "rent" + "rsi" + "n\\R"

This reconstruction revealed the full path to a common persistence location:

Identified Key: SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

2. Uncovering the Payload: De-obfuscating Dropped Files
With persistence established, my next step was to see if the malware dropped any other files. In the same block of code, I found a routine in the function sub_40A7A3 that was constructing a new string.

Instead of hiding the string in one piece, the malware built it character by character. It moved the hexadecimal value for each ASCII character into memory one at a timeâ€”a technique designed to evade simple string-searching tools.

By translating these hex values, I was able to manually de-obfuscate the string and reveal the name of the dropped file:

Identified Filename: intrenat.exe

## Conclusion & Key Findings
This static analysis successfully identified two primary functions of orange.exe:

It achieves persistence by adding an entry to the $HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run$ registry key.

It carries a secondary payload, intrenat.exe, which it likely writes to disk after execution.
